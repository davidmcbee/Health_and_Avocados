MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

(1) Simple Linear Regression for avocado prices.
Production (=feature or X-variable) and avocado prices (=target or y-variable).

(2) Multiple Linear Regression for production.
Climate data (=features or X-variables) and production (=target or y-variable).

(3)  Neural Network for avocado prices prediction (I believe we can use Neural Network ML to actually predict the price instead of just a binary outcome).

(Features) X-variables: region, date, harvest area, production, climate data, import-export data*, production data from other countries** 
(Target) y-variable: avocado price 

* in the GroupProject – Andreja - 04_Avocado_Import-Export and 05_Commodities are some additional data. I was thinking of using those variables as well as they can affect avocado prices.

** we can also use production data from other countries (Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic) as an X variable and “play with it” to see if we can better train our ML model?

(4) Unsupervised ML for classification of our data in order to uncover the patterns/groups.
